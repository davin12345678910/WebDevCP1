        <ul class="list">
          <li>
            Gaining programming project experience through various
            programming group activities and projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thoroughly planned and organized tasks required for the
            front-end components of an app that portrays
            how certain searching algorithms function with graphics
            and code output. Hope to use this app to promote
            a better understanding of searching algorithms and later
            more algorithms for UW students and more.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gained an increased foundation in CSE algorithms through
            research and group problem solving sessions
